# Life Insurance Mathematics
This repository contains Angéline Pouget's submission for the Life Insurance Mathematics exam at ETH Zurich in February 2024 for the corresponding lecture taught by Prof. Michael Koller in fall 2023. 

## Task Overview
### Task 1: Markov Model
- Definition of a Markov chain and Chapman-Kolmogorov
- Model per se, induced cash flows
- Calculation of Cash flows, including the respective calculations and proofs
- Thiele Equation
- How would you do a decomposition of the premium into risk and savings part? How would you do a technical analysis?

### Task 2: Stopping to pay premium
The aim of this task is to analyse the effect of a policyholder paying premium. We consider the following policy and want to see what happens if the policyholder stops premium payment. For students taking Life Insurance Mathematics, the question will focus on what this means re equivalence principle.

- Calculate the premium for the product at inception.
- Calculate the updated benefit if the policyholder stops after one premium.
- Calculate the benefit level as a function of the number of premiums paid.
- Which equivalence principle is fulfilled for the first premium assuming only one premium is paid? Prove your statement.
- Which equivalence principle is fulfilled for the second premium assuming only one premium is paid? Prove your statement.

### Task 3: Deferred annuity
We consider a deferred annuity with complete payback of remaining premium as a waiver against a regular premium. This means that a policyholder is entitled to get back the sum of the paid premium minus the sum of the paid out annuities in case of death, as long as this sum is positive. Typically this is considered as three distinct parts: a) the deferred annuity, b) the death benefit before payout of annuities and c) the death benefit after the withdrawal has started.

- Calculate the premium for this insurance, and split the premium into the three benefits – this is used to calculate the correct risk premiums.
- Calculate the mathematical reserve for the ages 30, 40, 50, 65, 70, 75, 85.
- Calculate the risk premium by type in tabular form for the above ages. To check correctness, please also calculate the respective savings premium, and the sum of savings and risk premium.
- What should the sum of risk and savings premium equate to? Can you prove it?
- Assuming that the above mortality is second order (i.e. best estimate), propose a mortality table which has a 10% margin.
- Discuss the construction of such a first order table in case of most policyholder taking out policies between 30 and 65.
